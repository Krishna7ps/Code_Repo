Many said it's good company and many more said it's not. You can understand this only by knowing how this company is organized.

99% of reviews are from tech guys-developers, admins, devops etc. They are divided into two main departments.
- Engineering(from CT office)
- Tech Support(from WA office)

This company is good enough for developers(whose designation is "engineering" as per Cybage offer letter). They may get good work that can help them with their career growth. Only glitch is,  sometimes it depends on project they are assigned to (perhaps, it's applies to almost all employees across the industry).

-99% of time, they have only general shifts
-Work 40hr in a week, 8hr/day(Compensate hours another day if you work less in a day)

But this company do irreversible damage to those, who were technically strong or wanted grow technically (whatever you phrase it),  if they are assigned under "Tech Support" department. Emphasizing only about this department henceforth. 

-During the induction, whatever good things they mention about company or facilities they mention for employees, those may not(90% of time) applicable to tech-support department. And pathetic thing is, they hint you that "tech support may have different rules"

From low pain --> high pain

-No cabs(it's fine if you have bike)
-No shift allowances(you will cry surely for this, after working continuously for 6-8days, continuous nights)
-40hr per week(strictly 8hr/day). 
-You got to stretch if your team-mate take leave. And you have to work 8hr. If you miss it by even one minute, you won't get leave added up. And stretching doesn't mean you get comp-off another day. So it's literally, working for weeks with less week-offs. 
-Most important thing is kind of work.
    -Don't expect growing technically. All projects are literally tech-support like. Means, "My name is ***, how can you assist you today?..... Thanks for calling" or "monitor it, we got alert, restart service, inform client". Reason for this being, all managers are once tech-support employees. They got promotion for staying in this company for long time. So their way of managing resources reflects where they came from. It doesn't matter how good you are technically, all they need you to behave how call center employees work: sitting at desk for 8 hr, monitor, update docs, time-sheets. Even if your system locks for 15 mins, that will be considered as you are not at the desk(this will be tracked by software that is running in the system).
    Also, project or work you get, may not be related to your previous work experience at all. 

-Don't mind about hikes. With allowances, one would have even more.
-No on-sites. If there are any, they are short-term like 3-4 weeks. For this you have to sign bond for one year. What you save in this 4 weeks of on-site is nothing as allowances are very less for on-site guys too.
