text_to_search='''Interestingly, the previous example shows already a "favourite" example for a mistake, frequently made not only by beginners and novices but also by advanced users of regular expressions. 

The idea of this example is to match strings containing the word "cat". We are successful with this, but unfortunately we are matching a lot of other words as well. 

If we match "cats" in a string that might be still okay, but what about all those words containing this character sequence "cat"? We match words like "education", "communicate", "falsification", "ramifications", "cattle" and many more. 

This is a case of "over matching", i.e. we receive positive results, which are wrong according to the problem we want to solve.
